## Abstract

The vector cost bimatrix game is a method for
multi-objective decision making that enables agents to op-
timize for multiple goals at once while avoiding worst-case
scenarios in neglected objectives. We expand this approach to
arbitrary numbers of objectives and compare its performance
to scalar weighted sum methods during competitive motion
planning. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is
used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making
data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries
using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore
performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity
study for the baseline and proposed frameworks. While some
works have explored aspects of game theoretic planning and
autonomous vehicle validation separately, we combine each of
these into a novel and comprehensive simulation pipeline. This
integration demonstrates a dramatic improvement of the vector
cost method over scalarization and offers an interpretable and
generalizable framework for autonomous vehicle behavioral
planning.

## Branches

The main branch includes the infrastructure for building and visualizing the simulation, as well as healess data generation with automatic iteration through the vehicle parameters described in the paper. The scenario_visualization repository is included [here](https://github.com/toazbenj/scenario_visualization) to make the XAI and visualization tools available. Also see the web app [Race Simulation](https://racesimulation.streamlit.app/). The experimental branch is where active feature construction is underway and is not reccomended for use. Sembas branch is set up to connect the simulation to its counterpart in the SEMBAS repository, which is available on the example-v0.4.x-race_simulation branch of the SEMBAS repo [here](https://github.com/Thomj-Dev/SEMBAS/tree/example-v0.4.x-race_simulation). More details for use can be found on the sembas branch readme. The legacy_mecc2025 branch is the state of the repository as of the submission date of the previous paper and includes the data used for that publication as well. 

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toazbenj/race_simulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/race_simulation
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   Ensure that Python and Pygame are installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Basic Usage
   
1. **Execute the Main Script within the bike_race folder**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/race_simulation/bike_race
   python3 main.py
   ```

   This will launch the simulation window where you can watch the races. You can generate videos of the simulation using bike_race/view.py.

2. **Using the simulation**:

   You can skip to the next race using the big red skip button if the race gets boring. Data is saved to the files cost_stats.csv for information related to each turn (vehicle states, costs applied, actions taken) and race_stats.csv for data over the entire game (wins, collisions, out of bounds, etc). These are in the data folder. For headless mode, run the following script for pure data generation:
   ```bash
   cd ~/race_simulation/bike_race
   python3 data_generation.py
   ```

   The data will appear in the cost_stats.csv and race_stats.csv files in the data folder. You can edit the file names/paths in bike_race/constants.py. The script will iterate through all spawning and decision making weights automatically, creating a large amount of grid search data. These files are what can be fed into the XAI software, which is included in the scenario_visualization repository.

3. **Editing Configurations**:

   All parameters are included in the constants.py script. To edit the decision-making method, switch the IS_VECTOR_COST flag to True. Note that P2 (green) is the attacker that does the passing in this case, while P1 (blue) is the defender who starts in front.
   ```bash
   P1_IS_VECTOR_COST = False
   P2_IS_VECTOR_COST = True
   ```

   You can also edit these parameters like the relative priorities of each objective along with the shape of the cost functions (slope).
   ```bash
   progress_weight = 1
   bounds_weight = 1
   prox_weight = 1
   
   PROXIMITY_SPREAD = 45
   BOUNDS_SPREAD = 205
   ```
